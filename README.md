The monty program

## Usage:
```monty file```
### If the user does not give any file or more than one argument to your program, print the error message<br>
`USAGE: monty file`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status <b>EXIT_FAILURE</b>
### If, for any reason, it’s not possible to open the file, print the error message:
```Error: Can't open file <file>```, followed by a new line, and exit with the status <b>EXIT_FAILURE</b>
where <file> is the name of the file
### If the file contains an invalid instruction, print the error message:
`L<line_number>: unknown instruction <opcode>`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status <b>EXIT_FAILURE</b>
where is the line number where the instruction appears.(<em>Line numbers always start at 1</em>)
### The monty program runs the bytecodes line by line and stop if either:
- `it executed properly every line of the file`<br>
- `it finds an error in the file`<br>
- `an error occured`<br>
### If you can’t malloc anymore, print the error message:
```Error: malloc failed```, followed by a new line, and exit with status <b>EXIT_FAILURE</b>.
### You have to use malloc and free and are not allowed to use any other function from man malloc (realloc, calloc, …)
